# 🚰 Bucket Problem Solution in Python 🪣

This Python program solves the classic **bucket problem** using three buckets of different capacities (3 liters, 5 liters, and 9 liters) with the goal of achieving exactly **7 liters** in the third bucket. The solution uses random actions and optimization techniques to simulate the process.

## ❓ Problem Statement

Given:  
- 🪣 **3-Liter Bucket**  
- 🪣 **5-Liter Bucket**  
- 🪣 **9-Liter Bucket**  

🎯 **Goal**: The third bucket must hold exactly **7 liters**.

---

## 🛠️ How the Program Works

The program simulates filling, pouring, and transferring water between the buckets through the following steps:  

1️⃣ **Filling buckets**: Each bucket can be filled to its maximum capacity.  
2️⃣ **Pouring buckets**: A bucket can be emptied completely.  
3️⃣ **Transferring water**: Water can be transferred from one bucket to another until the receiving bucket is full or the source bucket is empty.  
4️⃣ **Optimization**: A heuristic method (`set_optimization`) attempts to prioritize efficient moves to achieve the desired result.

## ⚙️ Key Functions

- **`fill_<bucket>()`**: Fills a specific bucket to its maximum capacity.  
- **`pour_<bucket>()`**: Empties a specific bucket.  
- **`pour_<source>_to_<destination>()`**: Transfers water from one bucket to another.  
- **`set_optimization()`**: Checks possible combinations to quickly reach 7 liters in the third bucket.  
- **`random_func_generator()`**: Executes random actions until the desired result is achieved.

## 📋 Code Output

When executed, the program outputs:  

1️⃣ **Number of steps**: Total iterations taken to achieve the solution.  
2️⃣ **Final state**: Water level in each bucket after achieving the goal.
